        I am an avid reader and passionate open-source developer. My work is focused on design and code user interfaces with a focus on accessibility and inclusivity. <br />
        I am interested in contribute to projects that aim to empower cooperation and self-management of citizens and communities and/or that explore the art of living on a damaged multi-species planet in time of climate change.
