In an effort to declutter my life, I finally decided to delete my Twitter account. I had originally intended to keep it in order to see how the platform would evolve under the leadership of Elon Musk, but after two months, I found that I was becoming increasingly dependent on the negative and toxic content spread and encouraged by Musk and his pathetic fanbase. I found myself doomscrolling a lot, and Twitter was exacerbating some of my worst tendencies and weaknesses at an alarming rate. Clearly not the best way to start the new year.

On the work side, I spent most of the week working on the bonfire user and admin settings, fixing several guest mode inconsistencies and consolidating the overall feed UI.
Finding a meaningful hierarchy between the several components that makes up a standard activity was particularly challenging, especially due to how boundaries affect an activity preview in different ways.
On this topic, I'm quite satisfied about the boundary redesign that mayel and I made during the last month, and I'm eager to release it and test it in the open. 

My daughter Aurora (6mo) caught her first cold which has made it hard for her to sleep during the first night. 
She's still her happy and energetic self though and she is getting better. 
This evening, while I was relaxing on the sofa with bea, it felt to me like she was crawling for the first time, au so proud XD
